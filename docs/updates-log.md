## Session — April 18, 2026

### MD File Restructure

Established new documentation system for the SnapQuote repos:

- `docs/current-state.md` — living document reflecting current project state. Updated with every meaningful prompt going forward.
- `docs/updates-log.md` — this file. Append-only session log. Starts fresh from today.
- `docs/archive.md` — consolidation of all older MD files. Lower reliability. For reference only.

All three files carry disclaimer headers directing Claude Code not to treat contents as ground truth and to verify in actual code.

Older files consolidated into archive: `README.md`, `docs/ai-workflow.md`, `docs/change-log.md`, `docs/estimator-playbook.md`, `docs/estimator-rules.md`, `docs/estimator-system.md`, `docs/project-overview.md`, `docs/testing-log.md`, `snapquote_architecture.md`, `snapquote_mvp_plan.md`.

Workflow updated: Claude Code is now the sole executor (no more Codex).

## Session — April 20, 2026

### Dashboard + Notifications Cross-Repo Audit

Ran a deep, read-only audit of two features across web (`C:\Users\murdo\SnapQuote`) and mobile (`C:\Users\murdo\SnapQuote-mobile`): the **Dashboard tab** and the **Notifications system** (bell icon dropdown in TopBar). Covered UI, data fetching, Supabase queries, RPCs, RLS policies, `.single()` guards, error handling, loading states, security, performance, cross-tab dependencies, and cross-platform parity. No code changes — findings only.

**Dashboard — architecture:**
- Web (`app/app/page.tsx`): Async Server Component, `Promise.all()` fan-out over analytics + credits + recent leads + lead_unlocks.
- Mobile (`app/(tabs)/index.tsx`): 4 parallel client hooks (`useLeads`, `useCredits`, `useAnalytics`, `useProfile`).
- Both render an identical 7-stat strip: Credits · Leads This Month · Estimates Sent · Estimates Accepted · Acceptance Rate · Avg Estimate Value · Avg Response Time.
- Data comes from `get_org_credit_row` RPC, `get_org_analytics` RPC (migration 0052/0053), direct `leads`/`lead_unlocks` queries. Same backend, different front-ends.

**Dashboard — findings:**
- **Web has no loading UI and no error boundary on the page itself** — a cold/slow `get_org_analytics` gives a blank page. Mobile has `LoadingScreen` + 7 `StatCardSkeleton`s + `ErrorScreen` with Retry.
- **Web `unstable_cache` tag `analytics:${orgId}` is never revalidated on mutation** — grep across the repo returned zero `revalidateTag` / `revalidatePath` calls anywhere. Stats are stale up to 5 min after a new lead or accepted quote.
- **Web `app/app/layout.tsx` has 2 unguarded `.single()` calls** (lines 32, 36) on `contractor_profile` and `organizations`. Missing row crashes every authenticated page, not just dashboard.
- **Mobile `.single()` calls all properly guarded** (all 4: `getLead`, `getProfile`, `getOrganization`, `getCredits` fallback).
- Mobile lead-list performance optimizations noted: batch photo signing (up to 2 preview photos per lead), `LEAD_LIST_COLUMNS` (19-field projection) instead of `select("*")`, `LeadCard` memoized with custom comparator.

**Notifications — architecture:**
- Shared `notifications` table (migration 0045) across both clients. Columns: `id`, `org_id`, `user_id` (unused), `type`, `title`, `body`, `screen`, `screen_params` (jsonb), `read`, `created_at`. Indexes: `(org_id, created_at DESC)`, partial `(org_id) WHERE read = false`.
- RLS: SELECT + UPDATE via `organization_members` membership. No client INSERT/DELETE — backend admin client only.
- Realtime channel names are distinct: web `notifications-${orgId}`, mobile `mobile-notifications-${orgId}` — both clients can coexist on the same user/org without collision.
- **50-per-org cap** via DB trigger `trg_prune_org_notifications` after every INSERT.
- **7-day rolling TTL** via daily cron `/api/cron/cleanup-notifications` deleting `created_at < now() - 7d`.
- **There is no "midnight clear"** — the concept is a 7-day rolling retention, not a daily wipe. Prior framing of "midnight clear logic" was a misconception; retention is time-based, not calendar-based.

**Notifications — 8 types enumerated:**
`NEW_LEAD`, `ESTIMATE_VIEWED`, `ESTIMATE_ACCEPTED`, `ESTIMATE_NOT_VIEWED`, `ESTIMATE_EXPIRING_SOON`, `ESTIMATE_EXPIRED`, `TRIAL_EXPIRED`, `INVITE_ACCEPTED`. Nudge/expiry/trial come from daily Vercel crons (expiry + nudge are grouped per org).

**Notifications — findings:**
- **Web `TopBar.handleNotificationClick` only handles `lead | quotes | team`** — confirmed by direct grep of `components/TopBar.tsx:47-51`. `TRIAL_EXPIRED` notifications carry `screen: "settings"` and no-op on web click. Mobile routes them correctly (to `/(tabs)/more/plan`).
- **Duplicate NEW_LEAD notifications possible** — `sendNewLeadNotifications` is reachable from 3 code paths (lead-submit after-block, rescue-stuck-leads cron stage 2, estimator terminal-state transitions) with no unique constraint on (org_id, type, lead_id).
- **`trial_ended_notified_at` column exists but is unused** — migration 0046 added the column and a partial index (`WHERE trial_ended_notified_at IS NULL`), but `app/api/cron/trial-expired/route.ts` never reads or writes it. The docstring (line 18) claims the marker is used; the only actual dedup is the Resend idempotency key `cron-trial-expired-${orgId}-${runDay}`. This is a wiring bug — schema went in, code never caught up.
- **ESTIMATE_VIEWED is CAS-protected** — `/api/public/quote/[publicId]/viewed` flips `viewed_at` only when still NULL; only the CAS winner fires push + in-app notification.
- **Web toast stacking on burst INSERTs** — `hooks/useNotifications.ts` calls `toast()` per INSERT with no debounce.
- **Mobile push-permission denial is silent** — `lib/notifications.ts` returns null with no UI feedback.
- **Mobile tap handler guards against duplicate screen stacks** — `app/_layout.tsx:224-229` checks `pathnameRef.current` before pushing, prevents duplicate screen + Realtime channel collisions when user taps notification while already on target.
- **Dead push tokens auto-cleaned** on terminal Expo errors (`DeviceNotRegistered`, `InvalidCredentials`, `MismatchSenderId`) in `lib/pushNotifications.ts`.
- **Web popover desktop auto-closes after 5s of no hover** — can fire while user is reading longer notifications; no pause on hover/scroll-within.

**Cross-feature coupling:** Dashboard and Notifications are fully decoupled. No shared queries, cache, or state. Notifications never invalidate dashboard data; a new NEW_LEAD arrives via Realtime to the notifications feed but dashboard stats don't refresh until its own 5-min cache expires.

**Cross-platform parity:** Mobile is more resilient than web (loading UI, error UI, guarded `.single()`s, offline-aware pull-to-refresh, push channel). Web has nothing mobile doesn't — no web-push support means tab-closed web users miss real-time alerts entirely.

**Strengths observed:** Strong RLS on notifications; CAS on ESTIMATE_VIEWED; per-device push tokens (migration 0039 fixed prior single-per-org bug); dead-token cleanup; 50-cap + 7-day TTL forming a clean lifecycle; mobile batch photo signing; selective column projections; `LeadCard` memoization; Realtime channel refcounting in hooks.

**Doc updates made in this session:**
- `current-state.md` header date range extended to April 15–20, 2026.
- `current-state.md` Notifications section expanded with in-app feed structure, schema, 8 types, lifecycle, push details.
- `current-state.md` new Dashboard section added after Analytics.
- `current-state.md` Known Outstanding Issues gained 10 new entries covering the findings above.
- This log entry.

## Session — April 20, 2026 (fixes)

### Fix: Layout `.single()` guards + `settings` notification routing

Shipped the first two fixes from this morning's audit. Commit `5285d14` on `main`.

**Bug 1 — Unguarded `.single()` in web app layout (`app/app/layout.tsx`):**
- The layout called `.single()` on `contractor_profile` and `organizations` with no null check. A missing row would throw and crash every `/app/*` page for that user.
- Fix: Switched both to `.maybeSingle()` so queries return `{ data: null }` instead of throwing. After the `Promise.all()`, added `if (!profile || !organization) redirect("/onboarding")` — same pattern `requireAuth` uses when a user has no membership row. TypeScript narrows correctly after the guard thanks to `redirect()`'s `never` return type.
- Added `redirect` import from `next/navigation`.
- The redirect target is `/onboarding` for both cases: profile-missing is the expected case for a half-finished signup; organization-missing is a data-integrity edge case that onboarding can reset.

**Bug 2 — Web notifications silently drop `settings` screen clicks (`components/TopBar.tsx`):**
- `handleNotificationClick` had branches for `lead`, `quotes`, and `team` but no case for `settings`. `TRIAL_EXPIRED` notifications (which carry `screen: "settings"`) did nothing when clicked on web, even though they route correctly on mobile.
- Fix: Added `else if (item.screen === "settings") { router.push("/app/plan"); }` — `/app/plan` matches the authenticated plan route and mirrors the mobile tap handler's target of `/(tabs)/more/plan`.

**Doc updates (this section):**
- Removed the two now-fixed bullets from Known Outstanding Issues in `current-state.md` (Unguarded `.single()` and silent `settings` screen clicks).
- Appended this log entry.

**Note on commit scope:** The commit also bundled the `docs/current-state.md` + `docs/updates-log.md` audit edits that were still uncommitted from earlier in the day (per the `git add .` instruction). Commit message is narrow to the fix; the docs reflect the broader audit.

## Session — April 20, 2026 (fixes — round 2)

### Fix: Analytics cache invalidation + dashboard streaming/error UI

Shipped the next two fixes from the morning's audit. Commit `b5cae91` on `main`.

**Fix 1 — Dashboard analytics cache never invalidated (`lib/db.ts` + 5 call sites):**
- `getAnalytics` is wrapped in `unstable_cache(..., { tags: [\`analytics:${orgId}\`] })` with a 5-min TTL. A grep of the repo confirmed `revalidateTag` was never called anywhere, so dashboard stats lagged reality by up to 5 min after any key event (new lead ready, quote sent, quote accepted, quotes expired).
- Added `invalidateAnalytics(orgId)` helper alongside `getAnalytics` in `lib/db.ts`. Both sides now reference a single `analyticsCacheTag()` helper so the tag string can't drift between cache write and cache bust.
- Called `invalidateAnalytics()` from every key event that shifts a count the RPC produces:
  - `lib/ai/estimate.ts` — right after the lead row is flipped to `ai_status='ready'` (and before `sendNewLeadNotifications`). Only fires on the success path; estimator failures don't flip any count that was previously zero.
  - `app/api/app/quote/send/route.ts` — right before the final response, after all writes (status→SENT, lead status→QUOTED, quote_events insert, usage increment). The idempotent-loser early return at line 175 doesn't reach here — correct, the winner already invalidated.
  - `app/api/public/quote/[publicId]/accept/route.ts` — right after the quote status→ACCEPTED + lead status→ACCEPTED writes, before the notification fan-out.
  - `app/api/public/quote/[publicId]/route.ts` — in the lazy per-read expire branch, only when the row was actually flipped (`effectiveStatus === "EXPIRED" && rawStatus !== "EXPIRED"`).
  - `app/api/cron/auto-expire-stale-quotes/route.ts` — once per affected org at the top of the per-org notification loop.
- Counted but intentionally skipped: `ESTIMATE_VIEWED` transition (doesn't change any count — SENT and VIEWED both live in the counted set). Estimator `ai_status='failed'` (doesn't change count — only 'ready' counts).

**Fix 2 — Web dashboard loading/error UI (`app/app/page.tsx` + `app/app/error.tsx`):**
- **Correction to the prior audit:** `app/app/loading.tsx` and `app/app/error.tsx` already existed at the segment level (rendered during navigation to `/app` and caught thrown errors, respectively). The audit was wrong to say "web has neither." What was missing was **in-page streaming** — the page was one monolithic `Promise.all()` that blocked the entire render until every fetch completed.
- Refactored `app/app/page.tsx` into three async sub-components, each wrapped in its own `<Suspense>`:
  - `DashboardSubtitle` — renders the "X new leads this week" line under the date header
  - `DashboardStats` — analytics + credits (the 7-card strip)
  - `DashboardRecentLeads` — recent leads list or empty state
- Each Suspense has a skeleton fallback that matches the shape of the content coming in. `SubtitleSkeleton`, `StatsSkeleton` (7 cards matching actual count), `RecentLeadsSkeleton` (6 cards).
- `DashboardSubtitle` and `DashboardRecentLeads` both await the same leads query. Wrapped the fetch in `React.cache()` so the two Suspense siblings share one request-scoped fetch instead of hitting Supabase twice.
- `requireAuth()` runs outside Suspense — if auth fails, `redirect()` fires before any Suspense mounts. Static content (date header, "Stats" label, "Recent Leads" header + "View All" link) renders immediately; only the data-dependent pieces await.
- Enhanced `app/app/error.tsx` with explicit `Sentry.captureException(error, { tags: { segment: "app", digest: error.digest ?? "none" } })` — more robust than relying on `captureConsoleIntegration` to sweep up the console.error. Added display of `error.digest` to the user as a support reference.
- `app/app/loading.tsx` left unchanged — still the right fallback for initial navigation to the `/app` segment.

**Verification:** `npx tsc --noEmit` exit 0 across the whole web repo after the refactor.

**Doc updates (this section):**
- Dashboard section in `current-state.md` rewritten to describe the new Suspense structure, shared React.cache fetch, enhanced error.tsx.
- Caching bullet in `current-state.md` rewritten to enumerate all 5 invalidation call sites.
- Removed the two now-fixed bullets from Known Outstanding Issues in `current-state.md` (analytics cache never invalidated, no loading/error UI).
- Appended this log entry.

**Note on commit scope:** The commit at `b5cae91` included two pre-existing untracked files (`AppIcon-1024.png`, `scripts/export-app-icon.mjs`) picked up by `git add .`. These were the user's in-progress icon-export tooling, unrelated to the fix but bundled per the `git add .` instruction.

## Session — April 20, 2026 (landing nav — color regression fix)

### Fix: Navbar showing black background at the top

The previous commit left the navbar hoisted out of the hero `<section>` (from the earlier "make it fixed" attempt). Without the section's radial-gradient bg beneath it, the outer `#101320` solid was showing through the transparent nav — visible as a flat black strip at the top of the page.

Fix: moved `<nav>` back inside the hero `<section>` (same DOM position as the pre-regression original), keeping the static positioning (no `fixed`/`sticky`) so the logo still scrolls away naturally. Nav className and all inner markup are identical to the original. No colors or backgrounds touched.

Updated the Landing navbar note in `current-state.md` to lock in "must stay inside the hero section".

---

## Session — April 20, 2026 (landing nav — revert to static)

### Change: Remove fixed positioning from landing navbar

User reversed the previous decision — wants the navbar to scroll away with the page instead of staying pinned. Removed `fixed top-0 z-50` from the `<nav>` className in `app/(public)/page.tsx`, leaving `w-full bg-transparent shadow-none backdrop-blur-0`. Nav position in the DOM unchanged (still a direct child of the outer landing container, above the hero `<section>`), so it renders flush with the top of the page and scrolls naturally. No other visual or markup changes.

Updated the Landing navbar note in `current-state.md` to reflect static-flow positioning.

---

## Session — April 20, 2026 (landing nav fix)

### Fix: Landing navbar scrolling with the page instead of staying pinned

Reported: on snapquote.us the SnapQuote logo + wordmark in the top-left scrolled away with the hero instead of staying fixed.

Root cause: the `<nav>` in `app/(public)/page.tsx` already had `fixed top-0 z-50 w-full`, but it was nested inside the hero `<section className="relative overflow-hidden ...">` which also contains a decorative sibling using `filter: blur(90–120px)`. An ancestor with `filter` (or certain `overflow` + stacking combinations) can establish a containing block for `position: fixed` descendants, so the nav was being positioned relative to the section instead of the viewport.

Fix: lifted the `<nav>` out of the `<section>` and made it a direct child of the outer `<div className="min-h-screen …">`. No className, markup, or visual changes — same `BrandLogo`, same Link, same typography. Now `position: fixed` correctly anchors to the viewport.

No other changes.

## Session — April 20, 2026 (brand — new lightning glyph)

### Update: Brand logo swapped to refined lightning bolt

User supplied a new SVG (`C:\Users\murdo\Downloads\AppIcon.svg`) with the same gradient chat-bubble envelope but a refined lightning-bolt glyph. Only the inner bolt `<path d>` changed; bubble path, gradient stops, viewBox, and all component structure are unchanged.

**Change — `components/BrandLogo.tsx`:** swapped the lightning-bolt path `d` attribute:
- Old: `M50.5 18L35 48H51L42 71L75 36H59L68 18H50.5Z`
- New: `M51.49 15.33L39.40 38.73H51.88L44.86 56.67L70.60 29.37H58.12L65.14 15.33H51.49Z`

All `size`/`className`/`iconClassName`/`wordmarkClassName`/`showWordmark` props and the surrounding JSX (wrapping `<div>`, wordmark `<span>`) are untouched. Component continues to render identically except for the glyph path. Every existing consumer of `BrandLogo` picks up the new mark without any other edits.

**Doc updates:**
- Added a Brand mark paragraph to the Design System section of `current-state.md` — source of truth, asset mirrors, and a note that `AppIcon-1024.png` is stale vs. the new glyph and needs re-rendering before the next ASC upload.
- Appended this log entry.

**Note on commit scope:** `git add .` also staged `AppIcon.svg` at the repo root (earlier extraction of the *old* brand mark as a standalone vector) plus prior doc edits to `current-state.md` / `updates-log.md`. The `AppIcon.svg` at root still contains the **old** bolt path; it was created and staged before this glyph swap and is being bundled rather than discarded. The standalone `AppIcon.svg` is not referenced from code; the live brand mark everywhere in the app is the inline SVG in `BrandLogo.tsx` (now updated). Worth a follow-up to either regenerate `AppIcon.svg` + `AppIcon-1024.png` from the new path or delete them if unused.

## Session — April 20, 2026 (fixes — round 3)

### Fix: Notification dedup + trial idempotency + toast debounce + tap logging + ActivityTracker logging

Shipped five fixes from the morning's audit. Code changes landed on commit `003eae9`; migration 0059 had already been picked up accidentally by the parallel-session commit `003b6a4` (see note at the end of this entry).

**Fix 1 — Duplicate NEW_LEAD notifications (`supabase/migrations/0059_notifications_new_lead_dedup.sql` + `lib/ai/estimate.ts`):**
- `sendNewLeadNotifications` is reachable from three code paths — lead-submit after-block, rescue-stuck-leads cron stage 2, estimator terminal-state transitions — and had no dedup. Two of those firing for the same lead produced two identical feed entries.
- New migration 0059 creates a partial unique index `notifications_new_lead_dedup_idx` on `(org_id, (screen_params->>'id')) WHERE type='NEW_LEAD'`, with a one-time `WITH ranked ... DELETE` cleanup of pre-existing duplicates so the CREATE UNIQUE INDEX can actually build.
- `sendNewLeadNotifications` now checks `insertError.code !== "23505"` before warning — the expected unique_violation is a soft success.

**Fix 2 — TRIAL_EXPIRED cron idempotency (`app/api/cron/trial-expired/route.ts`):**
- **Correction to the task prompt:** the user asked for a new migration adding `trial_ended_notified_at` to `organizations`. That column **already exists** (migration 0046 added it along with a partial index on `(trial_ended_notified_at) WHERE trial_ended_notified_at IS NULL`). The bug was that the cron never read or wrote it — the docstring even admitted the wiring was pending "in a follow-up migration." So no new migration was added; instead the cron was wired up to use the column that's been sitting in the schema since 0046.
- Query now filters `.is("trial_ended_notified_at", null)` so already-notified orgs are skipped.
- After the email succeeds, the cron runs a CAS update (`.update({ trial_ended_notified_at: now }).eq("id", orgId).is("trial_ended_notified_at", null)`) — concurrent Vercel retries can't double-set the marker.
- Docstring rewritten to describe the actual behavior. The stale "column should be added in a follow-up migration" text is gone.

**Fix 3 — Toast stacking (`hooks/useNotifications.ts`):**
- Added module-level burst-handling state (`toastBurstActive`, `toastBurstCount`, `toastBurstTimer`) with a 1.5s window.
- New `queueToast(text)` helper: leading edge fires immediately, subsequent arrivals within the window increment a counter, and on window close a single summary toast fires (`"N more notification(s)"`). The INSERT handler now calls `queueToast(item.text)` instead of `toast(item.text)` directly.
- UX: a single notification still shows instantly (no debounce delay). A burst of 10 shows one toast + a "9 more notifications" summary instead of ten stacked toasts.

**Fix 4 — Notification tap logging (`components/TopBar.tsx`):**
- `handleNotificationClick` now has explicit branches for two previously-silent cases:
  - `screen === "lead"` with no `screenParams.id` → `console.warn` with `{notificationId, type, screenParams}` + fall back to `/app/leads` so the click isn't a no-op.
  - Unknown `screen` value → `console.warn` with `{notificationId, type, screen}` (no navigation — we don't know where to go).
- `captureConsoleIntegration` forwards the warns to Sentry, so bad writers of `screen_params` become traceable in production.

**Fix 5 — ActivityTracker errors (`components/ActivityTracker.tsx`):**
- The `fetch().catch(() => {})` block now logs with `console.warn("Activity tracker ping failed:", error)`.
- Added a `.then(response => ...)` that checks `response.ok` and logs `"Activity tracker ping returned {status} {statusText}"` on non-2xx — `fetch` only rejects on network errors, so previously a broken endpoint (401, 500) would have been completely silent.
- Behavior is still best-effort — errors are logged, not surfaced to the user.

**Verification:** `npx tsc --noEmit` exit 0 across the whole web repo after the fixes.

**Doc updates (this section):**
- Notifications section in `current-state.md` gained four new Lifecycle bullets (NEW_LEAD dedup, TRIAL_EXPIRED dedup, toast burst coalescing, tap-handler logging).
- Migrations list updated: "applied through 0059" + new row describing 0059.
- Removed three now-fixed bullets from Known Outstanding Issues (duplicate NEW_LEAD, TRIAL_EXPIRED idempotency, toast stacking).
- Appended this log entry.

**Note on commit scope / parallel-session collision:** A parallel Claude Code session was active on `main` while these fixes were being written and landed three intervening commits (`bf56e5e`, `2802c06`, `003b6a4`) for brand/landing-nav work. The parallel session's `git add .` accidentally swept up the already-written `supabase/migrations/0059_notifications_new_lead_dedup.sql` into commit `003b6a4` ("Remove sticky/fixed positioning from landing page navbar"). By the time the code fixes were staged here, the migration file showed as tracked with no pending changes — so it's on `main`, just under a misleading commit title. The five code-level fixes are in this session's commit `003eae9`. No data loss, but the migration's provenance is split across two commits — worth noting for future archaeology.

## Session — April 20, 2026 (demo email domain fix)

### Fix: Demo account email showed snapquote.com instead of snapquote.us

Landing-page product demo displayed `demo@snapquote.com` in the owner identity card; correct domain is `.us`. Two hard-coded occurrences, both updated:

- `lib/demo/shared.ts:19` — exported `DEMO_USER_EMAIL` constant (canonical source used when demo data is generated/seeded).
- `components/landing/ProductDemo.tsx:756` — literal fallback in the JSX (`activeData?.shell.ownerEmail ?? "demo@snapquote.us"`), kept in sync so the display never shows the old `.com` even if `shell.ownerEmail` is missing.

Grep confirmed zero remaining references to `demo@snapquote.com` in the repo. No schema, seed SQL, or runtime copy elsewhere needed updating.

Added a "Demo account constants" note to `current-state.md` so this source-of-truth pairing is discoverable next time.

---

## Session — April 20, 2026 (demo email — DB seed override)

### Fix: Demo email still rendering as .com despite prior code fix

Previous commit `5d952ba` updated the two hard-coded literals but the landing demo continued to show `demo@snapquote.com`. Traced the render path: `lib/demo/server.ts:511` was resolving `shell.ownerEmail` as `owner?.email ?? profile.email ?? DEMO_USER_EMAIL`. Both `owner.email` (from `auth.users`, populated by the original `seedDemo.ts` run) and `profile.email` (from `contractor_profile`) were still `demo@snapquote.com` in Supabase — the pre-fix seed run. `DEMO_USER_EMAIL` was never reached.

**Changes:**
- `lib/demo/server.ts:511` — now builds `ownerEmail: DEMO_USER_EMAIL` directly. The landing demo is a marketing surface and should always show the canonical address regardless of what is persisted for the demo org, so this is the right place to force the value rather than adding a DB migration to mutate seeded data.
- `scripts/seedDemo.ts` — already consumes `DEMO_USER_EMAIL` from `lib/demo/shared.ts` (line 19, now `demo@snapquote.us`). A future re-seed will also write `.us` into Supabase, at which point the override above is a no-op but harmless.
- Grep for `demo@snapquote.com` across the web repo returns zero hits (only `scripts/run-estimator-tests.ts` still uses an unrelated `test@snapquote.com`).

**Why not a SQL migration:** The stale values in `auth.users.email` and `contractor_profile.email` only affect the demo org and only surface here. Changing an `auth.users` row requires the admin API (not a regular migration), and mutating the demo row has no functional value — the seed script will rewrite it on the next run. Code-side override is sufficient and reversible.

Updated the "Demo account constants" note in `current-state.md` to document the override and the three-file sync contract.
